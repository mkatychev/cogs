# Pattern matching
# * Matches any string
# ? Matches any single character.
# […] Matches any one of the enclosed characters.
# - A pair of characters separated by a hyphen denotes a range expression;
# any character that falls between those two characters, inclusive, using the current locale’s collating sequence and character set, is matched.
# - If the first character following the ‘[’ is a ‘!’ or a ‘^’ then any character not enclosed is matched.
